Your eyes do not deceive you: this is a newsletter from Fly.io. We've talke=
d about it for years but never got around to it.

For whatever reason, we've been doing a lot of things that our users might =
care about, and then not telling them. Since that's a popular way to kill a=
 startup, we're putting an end to that.

We're aiming for doing at most one of these per month. We're still dialing =
in the content, but we're pretty confident we can get to a place where even=
 our most cynical users (yes, you, Jeff) will find something they like.

Actual humans are writing this, so if you've got questions or something to =
say, just reply here.
